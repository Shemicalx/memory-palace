const Information = () => {

            <h2>Here we will memorize information!</h2>
            <p>
                First idea is to have a system in which a text will be summurized into its main point and then memorized in a stroy like manner connecting said words.<br/>
                This will go in one of a few ways - 
                <ul>
                    <li>text/the information -- word/words picked to represent the information -- story. </li>
                    <li>text -- ?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
    )
}

export default Information
